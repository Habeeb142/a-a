    <h1>Civil Law</h1>
      Civil Law is a body of laws that determines private rights and liabilities, and this law is different from Criminal Law. Civil cases usually involve private disputes between persons or organizations. Criminal cases deal with acts considered to be harmful to society as a whole and is prosecuted by the State or police. Civil suits typically seek to recover money damages or allow/disallow certain acts, rather than to imprison or punish a person.
